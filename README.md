Using the Laravel framework you will need to create a simple application for managing advertising campaigns. Advertising
campaign consists of fields:

| field  | type | description |
| :---:  | :---: | :---: |
| name   | string | |
| from   | date | |
| to   | date | |
| total   | float - 2 decimal places | |
| daily budget   | float - 2 decimal places | |
| image   | file | |

#### User should be able to:

- create and edit an advertising campaign
- see all created advertising campaigns and their details
- create and edit an advertising campaign
- creative preview button on a single web page
- creative preview button should show advertising campaignâ€™s uploaded creatives in a pop up for example
- navigate from campaign create/edit to campaign listing page and the other way around

#### Technical requirements
- Two API endpoints should be created:
    1. [x] Endpoint for submitting a new advertising campaign
    2. [x] Endpoint for listing the advertising campaigns and their info
    
- For the creative preview button, create a reusable Vue.js component. No need to alter any ```CSS```.
- files or spend time making the user interface look really nice.

#### The task should be done using:
- Docker containers for the environment setup (suggestion: Laradock).
- latest stable Laravel framework version
- MySQL database and structure via Laravel migrations
- Composer for any third-party libraries, dependencies, tools can be used if seems necessary
- Vue.js JavaScript library
- Using a cache engine is a bonus
- Adding seeders is a bonus

#### Your written code should be:
- PSR-1 and PSR-12 compatible 
- contain minimal documentation 
    - how the environment should be set up (Docker command to run)
    - how the system should be run (what command to run)
    -  how to initiate system's tests (what command to run)
    - short description of functionality in more difficult places could be provided in the code itself
    
- easily maintainable
- clear dependencies between separate parts of your code
- The system must be both testable and tested (unit tests are required)
- code understandable, readable, have a clear flow

#### Evaluation Criteria
-  all requirements must be met
- code quality (- it's maintainability, extensibility, testability; the speed of the system can also be considered but is not as important as other criteria.)
